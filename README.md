![PopGen.jl](logo.png)

Population Genetics functions in Julia.

This is a fork of the (currently) unmaintained `PopGen.jl` in `BioJulia` with the goal of merging our work with it. 

[Have a look at the docs!](https://pdimens.github.io/PopGen.jl/)

### Want to test out what's available so far?
Install the package in julia with
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/pdimens/PopGen.jl")
```

or invoke the package manager with `]` in the REPL and use
```julia
add "https://github.com/pdimens/PopGen.jl"
```
after the package is installed, load it with `using PopGen`

Feel free to play around with the test data in `/test/testdata.gen`
