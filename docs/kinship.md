## Background

There are reasons for removing kin population genetics datasets. For one, there are no siblings/kin or mixed-generations in a Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium population, and the inclusion of siblings/kin in analyses that rely on HWE assumptions [technically] violate those assumptions. However, there are also arguments to keep kin/siblings in your data, those data are important for effective population size, linkage disequilibrium, etc. [Waples and Anderson (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.14022) published a great perspective on the matter.
